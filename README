pecutils  --  peculiar utilities  for all your weird needs
==========================================================

Enjoy some of these fine utils for extreme use cases:

- inpuho - input hole

More oddities coming (hopefully) soon...


Utilities
---------

### inpuho

Program `inpuho` eats everything from standard input, ignores keyboard
interrupts like SIGINT (^C), SIGQUIT (^\) or SIGTSTP (^Z) and spits
nothing on standard output.


Requirements
------------

- mostly POSIX-compliant (POSIX.1-2008, to be precise) OS, like Linux
- GNU make
- C99 compiler, like gcc or clang


Building
--------

Simply run `make` (or `gmake` on BSDs) from project's root directory.
If you want to see what commands are called under the hood, then run:

    $ make V=1

Building out-of-tree is supported out-of-the-box. Go to your chosen
build directory and run there:

    $ make -f path/to/pecutils/Makefile

CC, CROSS_COMPILE, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS are respected (but extended in
the case of CFLAGS with `-std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 -Wall`), be it
environment variable or command-line variable.

Mind that if you're doing cross-compilation, then explicitly defined CC
is expected to include CROSS_COMPILE part in it already.


Installation
------------

Run `make install`. If you don't like defaults, adjust PREFIX
(/usr/local by default) or BINDIR (${PREFIX}/bin by default):

    $ make install PREFIX=/usr
